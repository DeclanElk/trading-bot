# Node.js Cryptocurreny trading bot

This is a simple Node.js trading bot that makes cryptocurrency trades based on simple moving average (SMA) indicators.

It is currently set up to user the [CoinSpot API](https://www.coinspot.com.au/api) for trading and the [AlphaVantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) for SMA data.

The AlphaVantage API endpoint for SMA data on Cryptocurrencies has recently been made premium, meaning you cannot access it on their free license. I will work to update the bot in the near future to use a different API that provides this data freely.
